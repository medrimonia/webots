On this test scenario, we have multiple valid and invalid positions for the
robots of both team:

- Team 1: 2 robots with invalid position
  - 1: entirely on the field
  - 2: partially on the border line
- Team 2: 2 robots have an invalid position
  - 2: partially on the back line
  - 4: on the wrong side
